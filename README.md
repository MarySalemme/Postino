## Postino

Postino is an app aimed to help notify people who received a parcel in the office. 
The app's main functionality is to be able to take a screenshot of the name on the parcel and send an email to that name.

This is a POC realised during innovation day. Next development stages are:
- create a native app for iOS/Android by doing TDD
- implement a database
- new feature: ability to print out the list of people who received parcels for that day.
